# Machine Learning For Riemann Zeta Function

We compared predictive abilities of Support Vector Regression, Multilayer Perceptron and Recurrent Neural Network models in the approximation of the Riemann Zeta-function zeroes. Using 80,000 observations across 50 selected features, our best model reaches over 99% explained variation and outputs predictions with a typical residual not exceeding 1% of the separation between consecutive target values.

This github project contains the paper (Predicting Zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function Using Machine 
Learning), a custom Python program that facilitated computations of Gram and co-Gram points (GramPoints.py), and the description of this algorithm (GramPoints.py Annotation). Finally, NeuralNetworks.R provides the R code for the
neural network models. For access to the data, please visit: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11uL0CyuHDXQkUsDLpb7DBCPOeiGgULua/view?usp=sharing

This project was completed with Jennifer Kampe and Huan Qin, PhD.
